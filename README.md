Elixir server for driving a string of APA102 LEDs.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/tinue/APA102_Pi.

This project exposes an HTTP API which can be used to animate a string of LEDs. Several animations are defined, as well as turning the entire string to one color or even direct access to setting individual pixels.
